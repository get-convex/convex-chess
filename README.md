# Convex

This example demonstrates how to build a fully functional chat app using React, Next.js and Convex.

The app was build within few hours. The computer just does random valid moves for now. Will improve later.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
rm -rf convex.json
npx convex init
npm run dev
```

## Deploy your own
